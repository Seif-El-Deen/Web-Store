## ERD
ðŸ”— [ERD Image](Diagrams/Web%20Store%20ERD.png)

## Entities
-  `Customer`, `Product`, `Category`, `Orders`, `Order Items`
  
## Relationship between entities 
- **`Customer` - `Order`**
  - One-to-many (1:M)  
  âž¤ One customer can make many orders.
- **`Orders` - `Order Items`**
  - One-to-many (1:M)  
  âž¤ One Order can have many order items.
- **`Product` - `Order Items`**
  - One-to-many (1:M)  
  âž¤ One Product can exist in many order items.
- **`Product` - `Category`**
  - Many-to-many (M:M)  
  âž¤ One Product can belong to many categories & a single category can include many products.
- **`Category` - `Category`**
  - One-to-many (1:M)  
  âž¤ One Category can be parent to many other categories.

### Trigger to create sale history, when a new order is made in the 'Orders' table, automatically generates a sale history record for that order, capturing details such as (order_id, customer_id, product_id, total_amount, quantity, order_date), After order insertion.
``` sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trg_sale_history
AFTER INSERT ON ORDERS
FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
	INSERT INTO sale_history(order_id, customer_id, product_id, total_amount, quantity, order_date)
    SELECT NEW.ord_id, NEW.ord_cust_id, oi.ord_item_prod_id, oi.ord_item_qty*oi.ord_item_price, oi.ord_item_qty, NEW.ord_date
    FROM order_items oi where oi.ord_item_ord_id = New.ord_id;
    
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### Trigger to lock the field (product on hand) quantity with product id = 120 from being updated
``` sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trg_block_prod_on_hand_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF OLD.prod_id = 120 AND NEW.prod_on_hand <> OLD.prod_on_hand THEN
	  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
	  SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Update not allowed: prod_on_hand is locked for product ID 120';
  END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### Transaction query to lock product with product id 120 from being updated.
``` sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Lock the row to prevent updates from other transactions
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE prod_id = 120
FOR UPDATE;

-- You can do your business logic here (e.g., read or update other fields)

-- Commit or rollback to release the lock
COMMIT;
```
